Hello All,

This project was assigned to me during my Web Development and Designing Internship at Oasis Infobyte.

This project used some skills to create a Calculator with basics Mathematical Functionalities using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Calculators require an interactive interface to perform basic functions such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. It required a display screen to display the userâ€™s input and give the results. The grid system in CSS is for the alignments of buttons on the calculator. The additional tools you need to build a fully functional calculator include eventListeners, if-else statements, operators, loops, and so on.
